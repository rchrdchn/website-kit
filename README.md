# Beginner-Website-Kit
This kit is for those just getting started in building websites.  We use only HTML and CSS with LESS and SCSS options.  Nothing else to complicate it.  This is as barebones as it get! This kit contains an entire website already built to use as a basis for a new website to build for a client.
